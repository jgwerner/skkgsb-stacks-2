# IllumiDesk Docker Stacks

Dockerfiles and related assets for IllumiDesk's workspace images. The purpose of this repo is to provide a template repo for IllumiDesk customer-centric images. To create a new customer-centric repo, click on the Use this Template button and confirm the repo name.

## Pre Requisits

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies

```bash
make venv
```

2. Build images

```bash
make build-all
```

3. Run:

Running the image standalone is helpful for testing:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 illumidesk/r-notebook:latest
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to access your Jupyter Notebook server.

> Refer to [docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for additional `docker run ...` options.

4. Test:

```bash
make test
```

## Build Mechanism

1. Build and tag the base image or all images at once. Use the `TAG` argument to add your custom tag. The `TAG` argument defaults to `latest` if not specified.

Build all images:

```bash
make build-all
```

Build one image with custom tag, for example:

```bash
make build/r-notebook TAG=mytag
```

> Where possible, images use the standard `repo2docker` convention to set dependencies. [Refer to this project's documentaiton](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional configuration options.


1. (Optional) Use any image available from the [`jupyter/docker-stacks`](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) repo as a starting point. You can override the base image by editing the `FROM` directive in the Dockerfile. Then, run the build with either the included `make build/<folder-name>` or the native `docker build ...` command.

Build with the native `docker build ...` command:

```bash
docker build -t illumidesk/my-datascience-workspace:latest vscode-workspace/.
```

Or, use the `make` build command mentioned in the previous section.

## Development and Testing

1. Create your virtual environment and install dev-requirements:

```bash
make venv
```

2. Check Dockerfiles with linter:

```base
make lint-all
```

3. Run tests:

```base
make test
```
